# Integrating LIME with CatBoost

In this repo we created an intro tutorial for LIME and CatBoost and how it could help to make decision about the features and the model

## Getting Started

You will need Jupyter Notebooks, `lime` package and `catboost` and `Python 3+`

### Installing

You can install `lime` and `catboost` as follows if you already have installed `pandas`, `numpy` and `matploblib`:
```
pip install lime
pip install catboost
```

Otherwise, you can also use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
